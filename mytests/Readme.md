# Test

Space for doing a number of small scale tests.

* `experiment1` - an attempt how different memory layouts impact on the
   performance. Wanted to do this before attempting to look to fit any of
   these changes to the `tinkerLite` framework.
* `experiment2` - see what kind of overhead is introduced by using a derived
   fortran type to code2 in `experiment2`.
